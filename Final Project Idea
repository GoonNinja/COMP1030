//game Name
Melee, Magic, Ranged

//counters
magic > melee
ranged > magic
melee > ranged

//game idea/explanation
player has 100hp to start. Max hp can only be 100
pc has 100hp to start. Max hp can only be 100
pc will have the same choices as player but randomized 
player choices: attack - choose your way of attacking: melee, magic, ranged
		block- block incoming attack by 50%
		heal- heal 30hp, cooldown 1 turn.

attacks do 10dmg which takes -10hp from player
if magic attack is used against melee attack, dmg will be doubled. magic- 20dmg, melee- 10dmg
if ranged attack is used against magic attack, dmg will be doubled. ranged- 20dmg, magic- 10dmg
if melee attack is used against ranged dmg attack, dmg will be doubled. melee- 20dmg, ranged- 10dmg

blocks negate 5dmg so -5hp will be taken if attack is used against it
if both pc and player use block nothing happens and goes to next turn

player can choose to use heal but it has a 1 turn cooldown so it cannot be spammed
if healing and attacked no dmg will be taken from attack
pc can heal but it will be random
